* **Linear regression** $\equiv$
a statistical method used to model the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables. a popular method in the field of machine learning for solving regression problems, where the goal is to  <u>predict a continuous numerical value</u>.  
The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, which means that the relationship can be expressed mathematically as a straight line. The model estimates the coefficients of the line, which represent the slope and intercept.  
Once the model has been trained on a set of training data, it can be used to make predictions on new data by plugging in the values of the independent variables and calculating the corresponding predicted value of the dependent variable.  
**example:** Suppose we have a dataset of houses that includes the size of the house in square feet (the independent variable) and the price of the house in dollars (the dependent variable). We can use linear regression to model the relationship between these two variables and make predictions on new data.

1. First, we would split the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set would be used to train the linear regression model, while the testing set would be used to evaluate its performance.  
2. Next, we would fit the linear regression model to the training data by estimating the coefficients of the line that best fits the data.
3. Once the model has been trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data by plugging in the value of the independent variable (house size) and calculating the corresponding predicted value of the dependent variable (house price). For example, if we have a new house that is 1500 square feet in size, we can use the linear regression model to predict its price by calculating the value of the line at x=1500.
4. Finally, we would evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set by comparing the predicted values to the actual values of the dependent variable. We can use metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared to measure how well the model is able to predict the dependent variable based on the independent variable.
